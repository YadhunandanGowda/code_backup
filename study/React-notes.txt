What is React?
It is Open source javascript library to create user interface


points :
React has component based architecture
reuseable code
can easily integrate react into any application eaither a small page or an entire application

npx is npm package runner which get installed with node
npm approach for npx create-react-app => npm install create-react-app -g and just use create-react-app <app-name>


Virtual DOM virtual representation of actual DOM
 
react create copy of actual DOM
when we manipulate any one element the virtual DOM will only update that perticular element in real DOM
which save lot of effort and time.
only update what ever actually needed
instead rerendering whole DOM React Virtual DOM will update necessary elements



diff types of event handlers

this.functionName.bind(this)
use arrow function onClick={()=>{this.functionName}}
above 2 have preformance issue

in constructor add
this.functinName = this.functionName.bind(this);
and in onClick={this.functionName}

fourth approach functionName = ()=> {
    this.setState({
        key: value
    })
}


component lifecycle

1. componentWillMount
2. componentDidMount
